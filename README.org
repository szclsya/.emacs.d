* Requirements
Basically you need the usual build stuff and some extra libraries.

** Arch Linux  
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# For jinx. Choose your language
libenchant
hunspell-en_us
# For tree-sitter
tree-sitter-grammars
# For eglot-booster. From AUR
emacs-lsp-booster
#+END_SRC

* Full installation
The Emacs Lisp part should be automatically installed when you fire up Emacs, but to make everything work there're some other stuff needed to be done manually.

** all-the-icons and nerd-icons
Install icons via triggering =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts= and =M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts=.
